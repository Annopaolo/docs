<h1>FAQs and Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>If you’re getting started with Astarte, you might be wondering about a couple things, or you might have hit a common pitfall.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-stream-data-to-astarte-from-devices" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#how-do-i-stream-data-to-astarte-from-devices" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  How do I stream data to Astarte from devices?
</h2>

<p>Devices stream data to Astarte through a Transport, which usually implements a specific data exchange protocol. Astarte’s default (and arguably most popular) Transport is MQTT/Astarte - a lightweight specification on top of MQTT which maps topics and payloads to Astarte’s interfaces and internal messages. In most cases, you don’t want to implement this yourself, and you can rely on one of Astarte’s SDKs instead.
Astarte’s SDKs implement all the needed logic for Registration, Pairing and data exchange, and expose a higher level interface to user which revolves around sending/receiving data from/to registered Astarte Interfaces. SDKs and their documentation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/astarte-platform">Astarte’s GitHub organization</a>.</p>

  <a href="#is-there-any-specific-requirement-in-terms-of-programming-language-or-framework-for-astarte-applications" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Is there any specific requirement in terms of programming language or framework for Astarte Applications?
</h2>

<p>No. Astarte exposes a set of APIs and protocols for applications which are meant to be used from any framework or programming language. Besides the fact that SDKs for common programming languages (such as Javascript) might exist, main interactions with Astarte happen through its REST APIs. Moreover, several other means of retrieving data with different logic, such as WebSockets and Astarte Triggers, are always available and can be leveraged in pretty much any application.</p>

  <a href="#what-if-i-wanted-to-extend-astarte-instead" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  What if I wanted to extend Astarte instead?
</h2>

<p>Astarte is conceived entirely as a microservice platform - as such, the main interaction layer among microservices is a shared protocol which is built atop Protobuf and AMQP 0-9-1 (RabbitMQ’s variant). Architecture-wise, we strive to make it possible to write plugins and extension by creating a separate microservice, which in turns makes it possible to extend Astarte with virtually any language/framework capable of communicating over RabbitMQ.
However, core contributions and modifications to the main microservices are always built on top on Elixir, except where otherwise noted.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-an-external-database" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#do-i-need-an-external-database" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Do I need an external Database?
</h2>

<p>It depends on your application. Astarte stores all data coming from/to your devices, and strives to do this in the best possible way. What it doesn’t do, though, is mapping this data to your application’s concepts and logic. For sure, duplicating data coming from Astarte into an external Database doesn’t make a lot of sense for the majority of use cases, and might require decent horsepower depending on the workload.
However, complex applications usually leverage external databases to reference Astarte’s data in their internal workflow. An example might be associating a device with its physical owner, whose personal data is stored into an ERP or a standard database and is never known to Astarte.</p>

  <a href="#how-do-i-choose-the-correct-aggregation-for-my-interface" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  How do I choose the correct aggregation for my Interface?
</h2>

<p>You should use <code class="inline">individual</code> aggregation if your endpoints are independent from each other and send data at a different rate. This guarantees data is sent only when it’s actually needed, saving bandwidth on the device’s end.
<code class="inline">object</code> aggregation, on the other hand, is more suitable for data that must be referred to a common timestamp (e.g. an array of sensors sampled together at regular intervals).

<h2 id="how-does-interface-versioning-work-how-do-i-know-when-i-have-to-install-a-new-major-version-of-an-interface" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#how-does-interface-versioning-work-how-do-i-know-when-i-have-to-install-a-new-major-version-of-an-interface" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  How does interface versioning work? How do I know when I have to install a new major version of an interface?
</h2>

<p>Interface versioning is modeled after <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, hence as a rule of thumb: a minor update is meant for adding new mappings, so that devices with an interface with the same major version but a different minor can still send data to the interface (it won’t send anything to the new endpoint obviously).
All other interface modifications require installing a new major version of that interface, which isn’t guaranteed to be compatible with previous major versions, and as a matter of fact is treated as a completely different interface from Astarte’s point of view.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-choose-between-datastream-and-properties" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#how-do-i-choose-between-datastream-and-properties" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  How do I choose between datastream and properties?
</h2>

<p>A property interface retains only the last value and it is used when the user is only interested in knowing (or setting) the current state. Properties are guaranteed to be delivered even if they’re sent when the device is offline, as soon as the device connects back to Astarte.
Datastream interfaces are used for streams of data and all the values sent are saved in Astarte. By default Datastream interfaces are delivered in a best effort fashion, discarding them if the device is offline or unable to reach Astarte, but this behavior can be changed tweaking <code class="inline">retention</code> and <code class="inline">reliability</code>.
